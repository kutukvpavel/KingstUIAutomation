# KingstUIAutomation
UI automation for KingstVIS logic analyzer software.

Since Kingst doesn't offer any API to control acquisition (and KingstVIS is a Qt5 application, so no hWnd-s for "controls"), the only way to automate the process is to simulate mouse input. Due to the nature of input simulation, this tool can be used for any sort of UI automation, not only KingstVIS.
